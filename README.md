This Project uploaded before adding manager functionalities and let employee login with employee id which is not neat it must be username and password. Search employee repo with "MAIN" it have proper project builted.

These project have following defects :
1. Login with employee id NOT username, password
2. Manager is treated as same as employee NOT priviliaged to add/edit his respective project and employees assigned.
3. and some short defects that are solved in MAIN post fixed employee project repo. SO search for that.
